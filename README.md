# Flare Systems Protocol Client

...

## Configuration

The configuration is read from `toml` file. Some configuration
parameters can also be configured using environment variables. See the list below.

Config file can be specified using the command line parameter `--config`, e.g., `./fsc-client --config config.local.toml`. The default config file name is `config.toml`.

Below is the list of configuration parameters for all clients. Clients that are not enabled can be omitted from the config file.

```toml

[protocol.ftso1]
id = 1

Signature submission is set differently than submit and submit2. See
`func (s *SignatureSubmitter) RunEpoch(currentEpoch int64)` in `submitter.go`.

```toml
[submit_signatures]
enabled = true
start_offset = "45s"      # start fetching data and submitting txs after this offset from the start of the NEXT epoch
deadline = "60s"          # submit transaction until deadline

[finalizer]
starting_reward_epoch = 0
starting_voting_round = 1005
start_offset = "500s"            # how far in the past we start fetching reward epochs from the indexer at the start of the finalizer client default is 7 days
grace_period_end_offset = "65s"  # Offset from the start of the voting round
```

Type 0 and type 2 are supported for transactions to Submission and Relay contracts

```toml
[gas_submit] # applies to all submit1, submit2 and submitSignatures transactions.
tx_type = 2                            # 0 for legacy and 2 for eip-1559 transaction
gas_limit = 0                          # (optional) gas limit for transaction. Defaults to 0, which will use gas limit estimates.
# type 0 settings // Note: only one of gas_price_multiplier and gas_price_fixed can be set.
gas_price_multiplier = 0               # (optional for type 0 tx) sets the gas price to be a multiplier of the estimated gas price. Defaults to 0, which will simply use the estimate, OR a fixed gas price if gas_price_fixed is set (!= 0).
gas_price_fixed = 0                    # (optional for type 0 tx) sets a fixed gas price for the transaction. Defaults to 0, which will use an estimate OR a multiplier of the estimate if gas_price_multiplier is set (!= 0).
# type 2 settings
max_priority_fee_per_gas = "20000000000" # (optional for type 2 tx) sets priority fee per gas for a transaction in wei. Defaults to 20GWei.
base_fee_per_gas_cap = 0               # (optional for type 2 tx) sets base fee per gas cap. Defaults to 3 times estimation of needed base fee to be included in the block. !!! It is strongly recommended to keep it default. Any fixed amount may prevent the transaction from being accepted !!!

[gas_relay] # applies to finalization transaction
tx_type = 0
gas_limit = 0
gas_price_multiplier = 0
gas_price_fixed = 0
max_priority_fee_per_gas = "20000000000"
base_fee_per_gas_cap = 0
```

Currently only type 0 transactions are supported for registration.

```toml
[gas_register] # applies to all voter registration transaction
tx_type = 0
gas_limit = 0
gas_price_multiplier = 0
gas_price_fixed = 0



[rewards] # reward signing configuration - clients.enabled_reward_signing must be set to true
# URL prefix for retrieving reward distribution data.
# A full URL will be constructed by appending the epoch id and expected file name: <prefix>/<epochId>/reward-distribution-data.json
#
# For example, if reward data for an epoch can be retrieved at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flare-foundation/fsp-rewards/refs/heads/main/songbird/240/reward-distribution-data.json,
# then the url_prefix should be set to "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flare-foundation/fsp-rewards/refs/heads/main/songbird"
url_prefix = ""
min_reward = 0 # minimum acceptable claim amount in wei for the identity address of this provider, default 0.
max_reward = 0 # (optional) maximum acceptable claim amount in wei for the identity address of this provider. If 0 or not set, no maximum is enforced.
retries = 8    # (optional) number of retries for fetching and signing reward data, default: 8.
retry_interval = "6h" # (optional) interval between retries, default: 6 hours.
```
