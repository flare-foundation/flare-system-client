# Flare Systems Protocol Client

...

## Configuration

The configuration is read from `toml` file. Some configuration
parameters can also be configured using environment variables. See the list below.

Config file can be specified using the command line parameter `--config`, e.g., `./tlc-client --config config.local.toml`. The default config file name is `config.toml`.

Below is the list of configuration parameters for all clients. Clients that are not enabled can be omitted from the config file.
